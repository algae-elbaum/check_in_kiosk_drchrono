# Check in Kiosk

A mini project for my application to drchrono

Provides a kiosk at which patients may enter their identifying information and fill out a form with data relevant
to their appointment. The doctor (or whoever is at a computer on which a doctor has signed into this website) has
access to a page which updates live as patients check in. That page lists check ins and gives a link to all the
form data the patient filled out

This is a basic django project with minimal bells and whistles (see requirements.txt), so if you have access to a
django tutorial then you already know how to set this up and run it. Send me a message if you want help.
